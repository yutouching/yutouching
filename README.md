### Hi there 👋

I'm Pan, an new developer with a passion for learning and growing in the tech world😃

Currently focused on mastering Python🐍 and full stack development🤯, and I plan to document my learning journey here🕶️

You can also see some projects— they are not perfect🤔, but both I and my code will get better🥇

I like playing games🎮 and building new things through code. I am also learning C# and Unity to design games😆. I really enjoy the process.

Feel free to reach out to me via email📫: mofish1@outlook.com. I'm always open to discussions about coding, gaming, or any cool projects you might have in mind.

### Let's creat something amazing together🚀
